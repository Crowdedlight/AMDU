# Arma Mod Differential Unsubscriber (AMDU)

AMDU is a tool I made to help easily unsubscribe from mods that is no longer needed. You simply give it the presets of mods you want to 
keep installed, and it will give you a list of subscribed mod you can remove. With a single click of the button you can 
also unsubscribe from all the selected mods.

## Requirements
It is a requirement that the steam client is running in the background as AMDU uses the steamworks SDK to fetch your
subscribed mods and unsubscribe them for you.   

AMDU is tested on Windows only, but built and in theory should run on both Linux and MacOS.
